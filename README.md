Simple Android video player for toddlers.

# About
This project was created in 2014 year when I had a little daughter and she wanted sometimes to watch some video on tablet.
Unfortunately standard video players for Android devices pause playing movie when someone touches finger on screen.
But toddlers usually touch tablet screen very often, they also hold devices in a way that stops movies (for example by
holding thumbs on screen). So idea was to create as simple as possible application that could handle this issues.
